#Stack Change Set:
	
	We have a stack which is already deployed and we want ot perform some modifications like we want to 
	ADD new resources to the existing stack, or we want to MODIFY the configuration of the existing resource
	; for eg- we want to change the InstanceType of the EC2 instance or we want to DELETE the given resource
u	from the stack so for these cases we use Change Sets.
